Body tab in Postman enables you to specify the data you need to send with a request. You can send different types of body data to suit your API. You can use raw body data to send anything you can enter as text. Use the raw tab, and the type dropdown list to indicate the format of your data (Text, JavaScript, JSON, HTML, or XML), and Postman will enable syntax-highlighting and appending the relevant headers to your request.

There are multiple methods for authorizing a request. Some examples are Basic Auth (username and password), OAuth (delegated authorization), and API Keys (secret strings registered to a developer from an API portal).

APIs that use API Key auth usually allow developers to sign up in a developer portal, where they will receive a random API Key that can be used to authorize their requests to the API. The API Key allows the API to track who is making calls and how often.

Headers: are how we can add metadata about our requests, such as authorization information or specify tha data type we want to receive in a response. This is different than the actual payload data we send in the body of a request, such as our new book information. You can think of headers like the outside of an envelope when you send a letter. The envelope has information about delivering the letter, like proof that you've paid for postage. The actual data "payload" is the letter inside the envelope.

NOTE: I can add Authorization to the Collection
