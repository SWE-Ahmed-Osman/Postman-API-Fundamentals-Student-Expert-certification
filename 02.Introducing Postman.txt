Postman: is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs faster and consume them with ease.

Before Postman, it was common practice to poke at APIs with a command line tool for making HTTP requests called cURL.
