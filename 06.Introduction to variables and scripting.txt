Postman allows you to save values as variables so that you can:
    1. Reuse values to keep your work DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
    2. Hide sensitive values like API keys from being shared publicly.

Variable Scopes: you can set variables that live at various scopes. Postman will resolve to the value at teh nearest and narrowest scope. From broadest to narrowest, these scopes are global, collection, environment, data, and local. If a variable with the same name is declared in two different scopes, the value stored in the variable with narrowest scope will be used. We will work with collection variables today, which live at the collection level and can be accessed anywhere inside the collection.

Postman allows your to add automation and dynamic behaviors to your collection with scripting. Postman will automatically execute any provided scripts during two events in the request flow:
    1. Immediately before a request is sent: pre-request script.
    2. Immediately after a response comes back: test script.

pm object: Postman has a helper object named pm that gives you access to data about your Postman environment, requests, responses, variables and testing utilities.

NOTE: Saving a value as a variable allows you to use it in other requests.
