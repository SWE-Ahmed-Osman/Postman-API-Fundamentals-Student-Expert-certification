Application Programming Interface (API): is a contract that allows code to talk to code. APIs are the building blocks of modern software because they allow for sharing of resources and services across applications, organizations, and devices.

Why are APIs important?
    1. APIs help developers integrate exciting features and build automation without reinventing the wheel.
    2. APIs allow enterprises to open up their product for faster innovation.
    3. APIs can be products themselves.

Types of APIs
    * Hardware APIs: interface for software to talk to hardware.
    * Software Library APIs: interface for directly consuming code from another code base.
    * Web APIs: interface for communicating across code bases over a network.

API Architectures
    * REST (Representational State Transfer)
    * GraphQL
    * WebSockets
    * webhocks
    * SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
    * gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
    * MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport)

API Access
    * Public APIs (aka Open APIs): consumed by anyone who discovers the API.
    * Private APIs: consumed only within an organization and not made public.
    * Partner APIs: consumed between one or more organizations that have an established relationship.
